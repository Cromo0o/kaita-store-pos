# Kaita Store POS: Point of Sale and Inventory System

This project is a Point of Sale (POS) system developed in **C language**, designed to efficiently manage products, sales, and customers through the console. The system integrates advanced search and sorting algorithms, file management, and recursion.  

## Key Features

### 1. Inventory and Sales Management
- Product registration and updates.
- Sales simulation with inventory control.
- Generation of transaction reports.

### 2. Sorting and Implementation Algorithms
The system uses different algorithms to optimize data visualization:
- **Quick Sort:** Used to sort products by **price** and to organize sales history.
- **Selection Sort:** Implemented to organize the list of **customers.**
- **Binary Search:** Used to instantly find products by their **ID**.

### 3. Data Persistence
- **Reading and writing files (.csv):** All product and sales information is automatically saved in plain text files so that data is not lost when the program is closed.

### 4. Recursivity
- Implementation of recursive functions for specific processes, such as calculating applied discounts or validation processes, ensuring modular and efficient code.
